# React Native Intent Manager

This is a simple cross platform intent manager (Linking works for the most, but i figured out some issues with android when trying to use the mail intent via react-native Linking)

The component has both iOS and Android support.

   * BrowserIntent
   * PhoneIntent
   * SMSIntent
   * MailIntent (Using react-native-mail for Android and react-native-communications for iOS)
       * Android:  [react-native-mail](https://github.com/chirag04/react-native-mail/blob/master/README.md)
       * iOS:      [react-native-communications](https://github.com/anarchicknight/react-native-communications/blob/master/README.md)
   * SocialShare
