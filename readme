This is a simple cross platform intent manager (Linking works for the most, but i figured out some issues with android when trying to use the mail intent via react-native Linking)

    - BrowserIntent
    - PhoneIntent
    - SMSIntent
    - MailIntent (Using react-native-mail for Android and react-native-communications for iOS)
        - Android:  https://github.com/chirag04/react-native-mail/blob/master/README.md
        - iOS:      https://github.com/anarchicknight/react-native-communications/blob/master/README.md
    - SocialShare

    ToDo:
        - CalendarIntent
        - MapIntent
